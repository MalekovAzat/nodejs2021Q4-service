## How to start the application in docker container

### Requirements

1. Installed `docker`.
2. Installed `docker-compose`.

The application contains several containers:

1. Backend application.
2. Postgres database.

To start the container use the `docker-compose` command in the root folder of the application:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command creates and starts 2 containers with shared network.

There are also an opportunity to choose the port for the backend application. For it need to change `PORT` variable in the .env file.

### How to test the application

For testing the docker containers should be turned on.
Execute next line in bash in the `backend-service` folder:

```bash
npm run test
```
